# New Zealand Procurement Guidance Archive

A static, one-page repository designed to preserve historical New Zealand government procurement guidance documents. This archive provides researchers, professionals, and the public with access to superseded documents while maintaining links to their current, authoritative sources.

Official government portals often remove previous versions of procurement rules and guidance once they are updated. This project aims to bridge that gap by providing a central location for historical procurement frameworks, ensuring continuity and context for those researching the evolution of New Zealand's procurement landscape.

- **Document Categorization**: Organized into logical sections such as Government Procurement Rules, Charter, planning guidance, and supplier resources.
- **Version Tracking**: Clearly distinguishes between "Current" authoritative versions and "Archive" historical documents.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main entry point containing the site structure and document links.
- `style.css`: The central stylesheet containing design tokens, component styles, and layout definitions.
- `assets/`: A directory containing optimized SVG assets and logos used throughout the site.

## Deployment

The site is built as a pure static web page (HTML/CSS/JS) with no build steps required. It is designed to be highly portable and can be hosted on any static hosting provider, such as InfinityFree or GitHub Pages.

### GitHub Pages

Deploys to [GitHub Pages](https://chandler-heath.github.io/nz-procurement-guidance-archive/) using GitHub Actions. The workflow is defined in the `.github/workflows/static.yml` file.
